# GitHub Actions Debug Analysis

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ Working Locally
- Gancio service: ✅ Active
- Port 13120: ✅ Listening  
- API connection: ✅ Working (200 response)
- Virtual environment: ✅ Present and functional
- Python imports: ✅ All successful
- Script execution: ✅ Runs without errors

### ❌ Likely GitHub Actions Issues

## 1. 🔐 Environment Variables Missing
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: `GANCIO_EMAIL` is not set in local environment
- Local: `GANCIO_EMAIL = NOT_SET` 
- Local: `GANCIO_PASSWORD = SET`
- **Fix**: Ensure GitHub repository secrets are configured

## 2. 🤖 Self-Hosted Runner Environment
The runner may not have access to:
- Environment variables from your local shell
- The same user context (permissions)
- Network access to localhost:13120

## 3. 🐍 Python Environment Context
- Runner may use different Python/pip than your local setup
- Virtual environment path may be different in Actions context
- Package versions could differ

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Configure GitHub Secrets
```bash
# Go to: https://github.com/CloudCassette/orlandopunx-infrastructure/settings/secrets/actions
# Add these secrets:
# - GANCIO_EMAIL: godlessamericarecords@gmail.com  
# - GANCIO_PASSWORD: [your-password]
# - DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL: [your-webhook-url]
```

### Fix 2: Test Runner User Context
```bash
# Check what user the runner runs as
sudo systemctl status actions.runner.*
sudo journalctl -u actions.runner.* -n 20
```

### Fix 3: Improve Workflow Robustness
Add these steps to workflow:
- Explicit user context check
- Service availability verification  
- Network connectivity test
- Environment variable validation
