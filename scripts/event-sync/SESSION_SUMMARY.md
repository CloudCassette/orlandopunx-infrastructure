# Orlando Punk Events System - Major Updates Summary

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Fixed Scraper Issues
- **Problem**: Will's Pub scraper was capturing "Buy Tickets" buttons instead of real event titles
- **Solution**: Fixed targeting to scrape `/tm-event/` URLs instead of `/event/` URLs
- **Result**: Now captures real event titles like "GODS. with Here Here and mode." instead of "Buy Tickets"

### 2. 🎸 Added Songkick Integration  
- **New Source**: Added Uncle Lou's events from Songkick
- **Technology**: JSON-LD structured data extraction
- **Coverage**: 2 Uncle Lou's venues (main + Entertainment Hall)
- **Result**: +6 additional DIY/punk events discovered

### 3. 🤖 Enhanced Automation System
- **Working Sync**: `automated_sync_working.py` - reliable event creation
- **Image Support**: `enhanced_sync_with_images.py` - downloads flyer images
- **Cron Integration**: `sync_wrapper.sh` - automated every 2 hours
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management

### 4. 🖼️ Image Upload Investigation
- **Research**: Deep-dive into Gancio's Vue.js image upload system
- **Discovery**: Found existing events have images, identified API structure
- **Solution**: 90% automated (events + image download) + 10% manual (image upload during approval)
- **Status**: Ready for future full automation enhancement
