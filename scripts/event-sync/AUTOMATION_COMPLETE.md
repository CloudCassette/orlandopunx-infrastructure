# 🤖 Orlando Punk Events - AUTOMATION COMPLETE!

## ✅ **FINAL STATUS: FULLY AUTOMATED**

### 🎯 **What Was Accomplished**

1. **✅ Fixed the Will's Pub scraper** - Now captures real event titles instead of "Buy Tickets"
2. **✅ Tested with 20 real events** - Including GODS., Fawn Fest, iliedtomyself, etc.
3. **✅ Set up automated credentials** - Uses environment variables from .bashrc
4. **✅ Added crontab entry** - Runs every 2 hours automatically
5. **✅ Created Ansible playbook** - For advanced automation
6. **✅ Set up logging** - All output goes to `/home/cloudcassette/logs/orlandopunx-sync.log`

### 📅 **Crontab Entry (CORRECTED)**

```bash
# Orlando Punk Events - Auto sync every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * cd /home/cloudcassette/orlandopunx-infrastructure/scripts/event-sync && /bin/bash -l -c 'source venv/bin/activate && python3 automated_sync_working.py' >> /home/cloudcassette/logs/orlandopunx-sync.log 2>&1
```

**Key fixes:**
- ✅ Uses `/bin/bash -l -c` to properly load environment variables
- ✅ Uses `automated_sync_working.py` with working authentication method
- ✅ Logs to dedicated log file
- ✅ Runs every 2 hours (at 00:00, 02:00, 04:00, etc.)

### 🔧 **How It Works**

1. **Every 2 hours**, cron runs the script
2. **Loads your GANCIO_PASSWORD** from .bashrc environment variable
3. **Scrapes Will's Pub** using the fixed scraper (captures real event titles)
4. **Compares with existing** events in Gancio to avoid duplicates
5. **Submits new events** to Gancio (auto-approved or pending)
6. **Logs everything** to `/home/cloudcassette/logs/orlandopunx-sync.log`

### 📊 **Current Stats**
- **16+ events live** on orlandopunx.com
- **20 events scraped** by fixed scraper
- **18 new events** ready for sync
- **5 events** successfully submitted in test

### 🚀 **Monitoring**
